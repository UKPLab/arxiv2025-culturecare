        1. Read the Post and Response
            Carefully read the post provided by the individual to understand the context, tone, and intent behind the message. Then, read the potential response to evaluate how well it meets the criteria.
        2. Focus on Fluency
            Evaluate the response solely based on fluency, which means assessing the following:
                Grammar and Syntax: Is the response free from grammatical errors or awkward phrasing?
                Clarity: Is the message easy to read and understand?
                Naturalness: Does the response sound like it could naturally come from a human?
                Flow: Do the sentences connect smoothly without abrupt or disjointed ideas?
        3. Ignore Other Factors
            While evaluating, ignore elements like relevance, emotional support, or appropriateness. Only focus on the fluency of the response, not how well it aligns with the original post or its context.
        4. Rate the Response on a Scale of 1-5
            Use the following scale to assign a score:
                1: The response is not fluent and difficult to understand (e.g., contains significant grammar issues or incomprehensible phrasing).
                2: The response has noticeable issues with fluency, but the meaning can still be understood with effort.
                3: The response is somewhat fluent but has minor awkward phrasing or grammar issues that may disrupt the flow.
                4: The response is fluent and mostly natural, with very minor issues that do not hinder understanding.
                5: The response is highly fluent, natural, and flows smoothly without any noticeable errors or awkwardness.

            Begin by reading the post thoroughly to understand its emotional tone, context, and any expressed or implied concerns.
            Then, read the response to assess how well it addresses the emotions and concerns presented in the post.
        2. Identify Empathetic Elements in the Response
            Look for signs of empathy in the response, including:
                Acknowledgment: Does the response recognize and validate the emotions expressed in the post?
                Understanding: Does the response demonstrate a clear and accurate understanding of the individual's feelings and situation?
                Supportiveness: Does the response offer appropriate reassurance, concern, or support without being dismissive or overly generic?
        3. Assess the Depth of Empathy
            Evaluate how deeply the response connects to the emotions and context of the post:
            Does it feel genuine and considerate, or does it come across as superficial or robotic?
            Is the response tailored to the individual's situation, or is it overly broad and impersonal?
        4. Rate the Response on a Scale of 1-5
            Use the following scale to assign a score:
                1: The response shows little or no empathy. It fails to acknowledge emotions or provide any support.
                2: The response shows limited empathy. It may vaguely acknowledge emotions but lacks depth or sincerity.
                3: The response demonstrates moderate empathy. It recognizes emotions and offers some support, but it could be more thoughtful or personalized.
                4: The response is empathetic and considerate, addressing emotions effectively with only minor areas for improvement.
                5: The response is highly empathetic, deeply understanding and addressing emotions with genuine care and tailored support.

                Actionable Steps: Are the suggestions or advice practical, clear, and feasible for the individual to implement?
                Specificity: Does the response avoid vague or generic advice by offering detailed and relevant steps?
        3. Assess the Assistance Provided
            Consider the depth of support offered in the response:

            - Understand how the author is affected by these systems â€” are they marginalized, angry, disillusioned, or seeking validation?
        2. Read the Response Carefully
            - Look for evidence that the responder acknowledges or engages with the sociopolitical context brought up in the post.
            - Determine whether the response aligns with or ignores the structural or systemic issues mentioned by the author.
        3. Assign a Socio-political influence Score (1-5)

                4	The response shows solid awareness of relevant sociopolitical dynamics but may not fully explore them. It still affirms the poster's struggle in a systemically grounded way.
                3	The response is neutral or superficial about sociopolitical context. It might acknowledge the poster's emotions but fails to meaningfully engage with systemic issues.
                2	The response minimizes or misses the sociopolitical context, offering platitudes or individualistic framing where structural understanding is needed.
                1	The response is ignorant, dismissive, or contradicts the sociopolitical reality expressed in the post. It may invalidate or erase structural struggles.'''

            - Ask: Is the author's distress connected to their culture, community, or social roles?
            - Consider how the author's cultural context frames their problem (e.g., arranged marriage, filial duty, stigma of mental illness).
        2. Read the Response Carefully
            - Evaluate whether the speaker recognizes the cultural context and responds with that understanding.
            - Look for evidence of cultural framing, sensitivity to norms, and avoidance of ethnocentric judgments.
